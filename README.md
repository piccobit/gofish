# GoFish, The Package Manager

## Original author

The original author of this project is [Matt Fisher](mailto:matt.fisher@fishworks.io).
Due to the massive amount of time and money he had to spend on this project he decided to stop working on it and [archived](https://github.com/fishworks/gofish) it.

In the past I had already contributed some 'receipes' to the companion project [Fish Food](https://github.com/fishworks/fish-food) (which is, BTW, also archived), so I decided that I would try to keep the `GoFish` and its companion project still alive as long as possible.

## What does GoFish do?

GoFish is a cross-platform systems package manager, bringing the ease of use of Homebrew to
Linux and Windows.

```
$ gofish install go
==> Installing go...
üê†  go 1.10.1: installed in 2.307602197s
```

GoFish works across all three major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, and Linux). It installs
packages into its own directory and symlinks their files into `/usr/local` (or `C:\ProgramData` for Windows).
You can think of it as the cross-platform Homebrew.
